We are excited to invite you to the highly interactive virtual WOLVERINE 2021: “Workshop on Open Problems in Learning and Verification of Neural Networks”, which will be held on Monday, October 18, during [ATVA 2021](https://formal-analysis.com/atva/2021/).

The goal of WOLVERINE is to foster networking and active discussions with a hope to spark new interdisciplinary collaborations. WOLVERINE welcomes researchers in formal methods, machine learning, and their intersection. 


### <span style="color:#b11170">Workshop Schedule</span>
<span style="color:#b11170">**First hour: keynote talk.**</span> given by *Prof. Sheila McIlraith.*\
